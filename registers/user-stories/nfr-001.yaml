title: Create a GitHub connector
kind: modify/register/item
description: >-
  As a Team Member I want to create a connector to GitHub So that I can store my
  data in a remote Git repo I control
justification: >-
  - Users need to connect a Git repository before they can start creating,
  building and publishing docs - It's important users are given the option to
  host data in external Git repos they control
