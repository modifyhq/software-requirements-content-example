## Why requirements?

Documenting, using and maintaining requirements at different levels of abstraction is an important part of making software.

Requirements get done in many ways - some teams still do heavyweight requirements engineering (e.g. in regulated fields), whilst others are content to write a few tasks in GitHub Issues. 

## Challenges 

Common challenges creating and managing requirements include:

- Poor version control for both docs and tabular data
- Lack of traceability between requirements and other artifacts
- Difficulty outputting to multiple formats for different stakeholders
- Poor access to templates and content relevant for modern teams.

## Why Modify?

Modify solves these challenges in a few ways:

- Docs are written in markdown or MDX and stored in Git repositories for robust version control
- Registers make it easy to capture tabular data stored as text and version controlled just like your docs
- Real-time collaboration and reviews make it easier for your team to hone requirements
- Relationships let you easily map and visualise the relationships between requirements and other artifacts
- Jobs help you build and publish docs to PDF, HTML, or whatever other format your stakeholders need

## What's in this repo?

The docs and registers in this repo provide examples of templates and content that teams with various approaches can use to capture requirements at different levels of abstraction.
