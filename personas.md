### Jobs

- Writing technical specs using formats that can't be easily mapped to requirements or development tasks
- Poor intra-sprint visibility on progress due to developers not updating Jira

### Jobs

- Create, review, update and curate content on the company's docs site. 

### Pains 

- Suboptimal collaboration workflow with dev teams updating product documented on docs site
- Learning curve using tools and workflows used by devs to manage docs (markup, Git, code editors, GitHub, PRs, CI, deployment)
- Navigating the directory structure and finding what I need takes time
- Waiting for builds to run before I can preview changes makes editing slow. 

### Gains

- Workflow that works for both engineers and technical writers, and doesn't require too much local set up or debugging knowledge
